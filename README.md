async function fetchFromAPI() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random');
    const data = await response.json();
    return { text: data.content, author: data.author };
}
```

**Note**: Direct API calls from browsers may face CORS restrictions. Consider using a backend server for production API integration.
